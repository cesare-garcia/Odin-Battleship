# Odin-Battleship

This project recreates the traditional Battleship game with two distinct game modes: Player vs. Player and Player vs. AI. I make use of Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, Jest for testing, and webpack. Players select a game mode and then place their ships either vertically or horizontally on a pop-up gameboard. Upon submission of their ship placements, players in the PVP mode are asked to click on specific tiles on their opponent's game board to launch attacks on their ships. In the AI game mode, the AI will automatically attack upon a miss from a player.
